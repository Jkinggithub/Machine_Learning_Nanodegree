    "The first Supervised Learning Models good for this problem is Gaussian Naive Bayes. Gmail will use it to decide if the email goes into your mailbox is a spam or not. The strength of the model is it has few parameters and is simple and easy to implement Use it to do inference is very cheap. When assumption of independence in Naive Bayes is statisfied and the data are not highly overlapped, it should perform well. When features are not independently given the class label, Gaussian Naive Bayes will make wrong decision. Since we have different binary feautures which describe age, class, sex etc. most of which are independent given the class label. SO it make Gaussian a good candidates for the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second Model I choose is Random Forest. Credit Card company use Random Forest to decide in which condition, the application of the credit card will be accepted how much is the credit line. The strength of Random Forest is that i it can handle categorical(binary) features very well as well as large number of training examples. It perform well when your data have outliers or the data range is quite huge. The weaknesses of the model is that it is easy to overfitting and once there is a new data, it might change the whole tree. When we have many condition cascade together and make the tree to deep, it will perform poorly. For this problem, have many all the parameter binary so that we could easily get a balanced tree. So we should perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Third Model I choose is SVM. In medical research, we could use SVM to classify 90% protain. The strength of the model is that it could handle high dimension and since it use kernal trick., so you could build in expert knowledge about the problem via engineering the kernal. It performace well when you have high dimentinal data. The weaknees of the model is that SVM do not perform well on highly skewed/imbalanced data sets and also not a good option if you have multiple classes. When we deal with those cases, SVM perform poorly. Data in this problem have many dimensions which makes SVM a good condidate for this problmes.\n",
